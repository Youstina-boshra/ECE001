What is Programming Language?
A programming language is a notation designed to connect instructions to a machine or a computer. Programming languages are mainly  used to control the performance of a machine or to express algorithms. At present, thousand programming languages have been implemented. In the computer field, many languages need to be stated in an imperative form, while other programming languages utilize declarative form. The program can be divided into two forms such as syntax and semantics. Some languages are defined by an SO standard like C language.

<p><strong>The Future of Programming Languages</strong></p>
<ul>
<li> Advancing technology promises that programming languages will continue to evolve. However, predicting the future of programming can be challenging. </li>
<li> As more appliances and devices are designed to operate with a computer chip, software will need to be maintained regularly to keep it up to date and functioning correctly. </li>
<li> Programmers continually face the challenges of protecting devices from viruses and developing applications that allow users to use their devices cohesively. </li>
<li> The newest programming languages will be faster and more intuitive with fewer errors and issues. For example, R is one of the most recent programming languages and was designed by statisticians for data analysis. </li>
